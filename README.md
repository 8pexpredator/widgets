### Installation Guideline: ###

1a. You may install a schortcut to select from your photo-library: [Install Setup iOS Weather](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3f47d801765b417e9a6ade5c897b1aa4 "Install Setup iOS Weather"). 

1b Manually store wallpaper images to iCloud folder:

Create Subfolder "iOSWeather" to your iCloud "Shortcuts" folder

Create Subfolder "walls" to the subfolder created above (in "iOSWeather")

Place your own Wallpapers (try to match your iPhone screen size,  --> [Device Screensizes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/ "Device Screensizes") e.g. iPhone 11: 828x1792 px MAX!!):

Store 4 Wallpapers into the folder "/Shortcuts/iOSWeather/walls/" with the SAME file names shown in screenshot below:

![files](https://github.com/thewaytozion/widgets/blob/main/img/wallpapers.png "Files")

The wallpapers can have the same image in it, but the intend is to have 4 separate wallpapers for lockscreen and homescreen with night and day time.
You may use the following wallpapers for testing purposes.
